Detecting Offensive Language in Social Media Comments

1.Developed an NLP-based classification system to detect offensive language in social media comments using models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM, and BERT.

2.Implemented advanced text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal) and evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for robust performance.

3.Built a prototype for real-time detection leveraging Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Flask, enabling live moderation of user-generated content.
